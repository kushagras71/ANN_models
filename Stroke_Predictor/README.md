Stroke Predictor
=
An ANN model for predicting the whether a person will suffer with a stroke or not depending on their lifestyles and habits.
The dataset is provided with the features of 29065 different people which basic information about there is life and habits which a doctor 
might use to check a person for predicting their chances of having a stroke.

The model uses those features to learn and understand the trend followed by the people how suffered with a stroke and who did not.

After learning the model can then predict for a new person with his/her set of features corresponding the dataset columns whether he/she will suffer with a stroke or not.


The list of features are as follows:

1.Gender 

2.Age 

3.Hypertension 

4.Heart_disease 

5.Ever Married

6.Work_type

7.Residence_type

8.Avg_glucose_level

9.BMI 

10.Smoking_status.

The predictions made by the model may not be accurate because based only on the data it is difficult even for doctors to say if a person will suffer with stroke how can be expect a simple algo to give out correct predictions.

The main motive behind this project is to show the working of neural network on categorical classification based of informational data.
Building are very precise stroke predictor is out of the scope of this project but this project will surely be update with new and more strong architecture and robust neural network.
